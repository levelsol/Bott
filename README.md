**TempBot**: Temporary Email Service

---

TempBot is a simple, efficient tool that allows users to generate a temporary email address for quick and anonymous use. Once activated, TempBot will:

- **Create a Temporary Email**: Generate a random, disposable email address that you can use for short-term registrations, sign-ups, or receiving verification emails.
  
- **Display in Console**: The generated email will be shown directly in the console so you can quickly copy and use it.

- **Wait for Inbox**: TempBot will continuously monitor the inbox for incoming messages and display the content of any received emails in the console, allowing you to view the messages in real-time.

This tool is perfect for handling one-off registrations or testing without the need to expose your personal email address.
